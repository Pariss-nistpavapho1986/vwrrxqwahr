Just walked out. Can't even feel my legs, back crackling like an old wooden floor. Popcorn dust everywhere, why do they even make seats that uncomfortable? But wow, Antes del cuerpo... imagine if a peacock could paint? Colors exploding like a broken kaleidoscope — it makes no sense but neither does life, right?

The opening scene, with those birds — maybe cranes? — was stuck in my head like that last song before bed. They were like thoughts flickering through a half-open curtain. Nature does its own choreography. Got so caught up, someone spilled soda, didn't even flinch.

> The essence of it... she was like a jaguar prowling through her own existential crisis, but with the grace of a marionette on strings too thin to be believed in. How they move, those characters, almost like they don’t know where their own limbs end and the world begins. Beautiful and terrifying, like watching an antelope escape, or not escape, a lion.

Random thought — could hear someone coughing in the back, might've been me? Theater noises became this weird urban jungle. Doesn’t even matter, need to download the movie, let those sounds blend into the wallpaper of daily life.

And then the ending, I guess, wrestling with the shadows of your consciousness, like a cat chasing its tail under moonlight. Who knew shadows could have so much... substance? Wham! Hit me like the dusty tail of a lizard I chased as a kid.

Watch the movie, if only to answer the question no one ever asked but everyone feels — why do we still long for connection like trees stretch towards the sun even when there’s none? Dunno, maybe that's too deep, maybe it’s just late.

Thinking back... was it even about animals or the inner labyrinth of the self? Hard to tell. But my zoologist brain is spinning like a spider weaving too many webs at once. Sometimes words are just inadequate. Did my friend ask me to watch this? Did I tell her I'd send my thoughts? Who knows.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5000; i += 47.3) {
        // what is existence.flow();
        printf(this makes no sense);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
